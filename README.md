# Cricket Match Target Revision via DLS (Duckworth–Lewis–Stern)

## Overview
This project explores the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern (DLS) method for revising cricket match targets in interrupted games. It combines mathematical analysis, data visualization, and web development to provide an interactive tool for understanding and applying the DLS model.

## Features
- Interactive website to compute revised cricket match targets using the DLS method
- Visualization of resource curves based on overs remaining and wickets lost
- Manual computation and validation for various match scenarios
- Educational content explaining the DLS method and its mathematical foundation

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for web interface and dynamic calculations)
- Desmos (for resource curve visualization)
- PPT (for presentation and documentation)

## How It Works
- Users input match details (overs, wickets, scores) into the web interface
- The tool calculates revised targets using the DLS formula and displays results instantly
- Resource curves are visualized to illustrate consumption dynamics and model behavior

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the mathematical principles behind the DLS method
- Apply integral calculus to real-world sports analytics
- Develop interactive web applications for data-driven decision making

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PatelApurv22/Calculus-Project-2023.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` or `DLS CALC.html` in your browser.
3. Enter match parameters to compute revised targets and view resource curves.
